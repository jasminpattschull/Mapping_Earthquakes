### Mapping Earthquakes Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to provide three deliverables.  The first was to add in tectonic plate data to the map we had already provided via the Module 13 work.  The second was pulling in major earthquake data from the last seven days and plotting those as color-coded points.  The third deliverable was to add in a third map layer.

## Results

The final map contains the original earthquake data, tectonic plate data and major earthquake data.  These all can be toggled on and off.  There are also three layers; streets, satellite and night navigation.  These can only be selected one at a time.

## Summary

I initially struggled with getting my major earthquake data from the last seven days to generate without the blue standard markers.  I had the circle markers generated with the pop-up messages but the blue markers were because I had a duplicated line in my code that needed cleaned up.  I enjoy doing more "front end" work and found this week to be very interesting and something I'd like to expand upon further post-Bootcamp.
